# Calendar-Manager

Google Calendar Manager because I am a busy man.

The basis of this project is inspired by [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUOtS6zU40A), where I wanted to explore Google APIs and start delving into SQL.

This project is basic but provides a way to manage my important Google Calendar events through the command line.

To run the code, the following needs to be done:

- A Google Cloud project should be created, and the credentials should be downloaded into a file called `credentials.json`.
- A file called `secrets.py` should contain all of the Calendar IDs that want to be added to the program.
